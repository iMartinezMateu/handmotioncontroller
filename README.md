# HandMotionController
## Introduction
**HandMotionController** (HMC) is a Unity plug-in that makes possible to developers implement a new input controller based on the player's hand gestures.

## Installation
Just copy the appropiate folder from the repository to the *Assets* folder of your game.

* If you are compiling the game from a x64 system, then copy the *HMC_x64* folder from this repository.
* If you are compiling the game from a x86 system, then copy the *HMC_x86* folder from this repository.

Not following above instructions, Unity will complain about using wrong architecture DLL's in the game.
